I began my acting career touring the country in children's theatre. Fortnightly rep followed before commencing a national tour of Hay Fever with the late Phyllis Calvert.

Theatre radio and television roles kept me busy, including in 1976 becoming a Robot of Death in a Dr. Who series with Tom Baker! I made my West End debut that same year in "A Murder at the Vicarage" with the late Derek Bond at the FortuneTheatre. 
I recorded Gerald Durrell's book "Animal Menagery" for the BBC on the death of the great naturalist and author and joined  John Nettles in the cast of the BBC's radio play "The Jersey Lily" playing Oscar Wilde.

My career took a different path in following years until 2008 when I returned in a movie for American television, The African Campaign. My next role was playing the Governor in the feature film Tormented released by Warner Brothers in 2009. More recently I played Uncle Willie in High Society staged at The London fringe theatre, Upstairs at the Gatehouse. 
I have also worked on a corporate DVD for Fullrange Films and played an Icelandic detective for an internet trailer for the book Hypothemia.

I have a natural RP voice, described as having a rich tone that creates a sense of warmth, assurance, trust and confidence. My vocal versatility allows me employ a whole range of character voices and emotions.
